/*
• Class having pure virtual function is a abstract class
• Abstract class can have concrete also.
• Object of abstract class cannot be created
• Derived class can must override pure virtual function, otherwise it will also become a abstract
class.
• Pointer of abstract class can be created
• Pointer of abstract class can hold object of derived class
• Abstract classes are used for achieving polymorphism
••
Base class can be
• Concrete
• Abstract with some concrete and some pure virtual functions
• All virtual functions
